## MiControl
C# application/library for controlling MiLight WiFi enabled lightbulbs

### What is it?

MiControl is an application/library for controlling WiFi enabled <a href="http://www.milight.com/">MiLight</a> light bulbs, written in C#. It has a user interface _(MiControlGUI)_ for controlling your MiLight's and a library (<a href="http://github.com/Milfje/MiControl/wiki/MiControl">MiControl</a>) for writing your own applications to control MiLight's.

See the <a href="https://github.com/Milfje/MiControl/wiki">Wiki</a> for more information.

### What will it become?

The goal of this project is to create an application/library with advanced functions to make use of the full potential of these cheap wireless RGB lights. Functions that will be implemented are for example:

* Setting the color of the light to match your screen (Ambilight functionality)
* Synchronising color changes to music (Audio visualisation)
* Scheduling switching/color changing (Visual alarm clock)
* Switching by rules (i.e. turn lights on when phone enters local WiFi)

By using the code of the MiControl library, you could think up and create anything to control these lights!
