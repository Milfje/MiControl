## MiControl
C# application/library for controlling MiLight WiFi enabled lightbulbs. It is currently in development.

### What is it?

MiControl is an application/library for controlling <a href="http://www.milight.com/">MiLight</a> light bulbs connected to a MiLight WiFi controller, written in C#. It has a user interface _(MiControlGUI)_ for directly controlling and a library _(<a href="http://github.com/Milfje/MiControl/wiki/MiControl">MiControl</a>)_ for writing your own applications to control MiLight light bulbs.

See the <a href="https://github.com/Milfje/MiControl/wiki">Wiki</a> for more information.

### What will it become?

The goal of this project is to create an application/library with advanced functions to make use of the full potential of these cheap wirelessly controllable lights. Functions that will be implemented are for example:

* Simple switching and changing color.
* Setting the color of the light to match your screen (Ambilight functionality).
* Synchronising color changes to music (Audio visualisation).
* Scheduling switching/color changing (Visual alarm clock).
* Switching by rules (i.e. turn lights on when phone enters local WiFi).

By using the code of the MiControl library, you could create anything to control these lights!
